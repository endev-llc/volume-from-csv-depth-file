in the current code of my testing-grounds.html webpage, i have visualized the voxels that are populated for each uploaded csv file. the voxels that populate are only covering the exterior of the object. In order to calculate the real volume of the object, the INTERIOR of the object must be filled with voxels (seeing as the voxels are our unit of volume), and must not be hollow as is the case currently. Make it so that our webpage fills the object with voxels, then calculate the volume based on those filled voxels. THEN we can calibrate, seeing as weâ€™re now measuring the right thing.

Brainstorm the best way in which to take the currently hollow 3d point cloud objects and FILL THEM with voxels, NOT outline them with voxels, as simply and robustly as possible, then implement this method directly into my testing-grounds.html file for me. note that the csv files im uploading are large, 4MB.
